# ansible

A few simple roles / plays I've put together in learning how to use Ansible can be found under their corresponding directories.

Examples
 - `roles/` - A collection of custom ansible roles for various services
 - `plays/` - A collection of custom ansible plays for various uses
 - `core.yml`  - Playbook example for using core configuration role
 - `docker.yml` - Playbook example for using docker install role (Debian / Ubuntu)
 - `make-host.yml` - Playbook example for using multiple roles together to create a new host
 - `hosts` - Sample / partially default ansible hosts file
