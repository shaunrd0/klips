# Ansible 

A few simple roles / plays I've put together in learning how to use Ansible can be found under their corresponding directories.

Examples
 - core.yml  - Playbook example for using core configuration role
 - docker.yml - Playbook example for using docker install role (Debian / Ubuntu)
 - hosts - Sample / partially default ansible hosts file
 - make-host.yml - Playbook example for using multiple roles together to create a new host
 - nginx.yml - Playbook example for using nginx role 
 - fail2ban.yml - Playbook example for using fail2ban role 
 - postfix.yml - Playbook example for using postfix role
