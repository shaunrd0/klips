This directory contains a collection of Python scripts or CLI tools that I've made.
Each of these projects provide a `requirements.txt` that can be used to 
install the required Python packages and dependencies.

To install Python 3.9 and `pip`

```bash
sudo apt install python3.9 python3-pip 
python3.9 -m pip install -U pip
```
