# klips

This repository is a collection of code snippets that I reuse, clone, or frequently refer to. This can be cloned as a whole or just viewed / copied as needed, used to lay out templates / automate tasks for larger projects.

The snippets are organized within topic-labeled folders. 'plates' is short-hand for templates, and houses all folders / projects that can be copied and edited / adjusted locally as templates for larger projects.

Other directories could contain configuration files, bash exports, scripts, etc.
