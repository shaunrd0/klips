This is a testing project I created while first learning C#.
There's no objective or goal, aside from playing with different features of C# and NuGet packages.
Essentially, this is a scrap project that I code in while learning new C# things.
Since this is just for learning, I won't bother explaining how to use things here; It's very possible this entire project could disappear one day.
