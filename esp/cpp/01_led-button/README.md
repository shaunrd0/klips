# 01_led-button

This example is largely adapted from those in [ESP32-basic-starter-kit.pdf](./ESP32-basic-starter-kit.pdf).

The APIs in the original examples paired with this PDF have changed, and I decided to do some different things with the code and/or circuits, but the original code can be [found here](https://www.dropbox.com/scl/fo/6znlij3eb23ih4jxcpv2w/AKvB1t9CCUgoVRVtGen8Yrw?rlkey=z84anl0hs940qf9fpl7l8q8q2&e=1&dl=0).
