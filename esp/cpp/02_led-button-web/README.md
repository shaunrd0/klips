# 02_led-button-web

![schematic](./schematic.png)

This example uses the same schematic as [01_led-button](../01_led-button/).

The only difference is that you can also control the button through a web browser from any device connected to your local network.

This example was adapted from the example code in the [Arduino ESP32 API reference](https://docs.espressif.com/projects/arduino-esp32/en/latest/api/wifi.html#wi-fi-ap-example).
